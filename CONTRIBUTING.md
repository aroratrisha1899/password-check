People create new cedentials everyday. We need to create a code which will check if the input credentials matches the credentials stored in variables.
1. Create variables to store credentials.
2. Give input credentials
3. Write a code to compare the input creds with creds stored in variable
4. If the password matches,the code should again ask for new comparison.
