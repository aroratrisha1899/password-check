# password-check
People create new passwords everyday. We need to create a code which will check if the input password is correct or not. For this, firstly create a variable which will store the password. Then write a code to check if the input password matches the password stored in variable.
1. Create a variable
2. Store the password in this variable.
3. Give input password 
4. 4. Write a code to compare the input password with password stored in variable
5. If the password matches,the code should again ask for new comparison. The code should be able to re-execute i.e the code should be able to repeat steps 1 to 4 and not stop with just one execution.
